# TensorFlow Object Detection API Example Of Usage

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue)
![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-2.10-orange)

A TensorFlow-based object detection pipeline using the SSD ResNet50 V1 FPN 640x640 model.  
This project demonstrates how to set up, run, and use object detection with 
pre-trained models from the [TensorFlow Model Zoo](
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md).

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository provides a framework to:
- Perform object detection on images using TensorFlow 2.
- Use pre-trained models for inference and integrate them into custom applications.

> This project is intended for students studying computer vision.
> Each group (brigade) receives a specific object detection task listed below.

## 📋 Detection Task Variants for Student Groups

| Group № | Object to Detect | Additional Requirements                              |
|---------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| 2       | Laptop           | Add frames where the screen is clearly visible       |
| 3       | Wallet           | Include both opened and closed wallet images         |
| 4       | Keyboard         | Add both full-size and mini keyboard examples        |
| 5       | Notepad          | Include images with handwritten text                 |
| 6       | Headphones       | Cover both over-ear and in-ear types                 |
| 7       | Coffee cup       | Include images with and without liquid inside        |
